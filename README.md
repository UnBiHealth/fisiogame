# fisiogame

Fisiogame is a game designed for use in physiotherapy sessions so to keep the patient motivated as the treatment goes on. It was developed by [Lu√≠sa Nunes](https://github.com/LBNunes) within the UnBiquitous research group.

The purpose of this project was not only to provide a game that could be used in physical rehabilitation, but also to make it input-agnostic: it's meant to work with any motion capturing device. For that purpose, it uses the UnBiHealth framework by [Luciano Santos](https://github.com/lhsantos), which allows for separating game logic from motion capturing logic.
